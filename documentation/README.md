# Bulk Field Editor Documentation

## Summary

**Category:** Best use of SPE to help Content authors and Marketers

The purpose of our module is to enable a content editor to quickly and easily edit multiple items simultaneously. With the Bulk Field Editor a content editor can walk through a few easy to understand steps to select the type of item, the fields to edit, and the specific items to make changes too. The Editor can be easily accessed right from the content editor from a ribbon button.
